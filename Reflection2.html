It's 2nd qtr, halfway done with the school year! Out of the things in CSS we learned, the ones I'll be using most are the ones related to adjusting the background (photos, colors, repeating patterns) and photos(mainly float). I also like using "display: flex;" instead of tables. Honestly, I didn't expect how much I'd struggle with CSS. I can understand how things work when I code but I don't know what to answer in exams. CSS is fun though, I like designing the webpages but it's a struggle to get it to work sometimes. I remember spending about an hour getting my main webpage in the portfolio to work. This quarter has taught me a lot about patience and practice. The more I practiced coding, the easier it got. I learned that I shouldn't be too frustrated when my code works, sometimes I need to take a break and when I come back, I can spot the error I made. I also learned I shouldn't be rushing coding because I know I am bound to make mistakes by doing so. This quarter was great and I look forward to the next one.
