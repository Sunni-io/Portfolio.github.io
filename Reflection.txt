As the 1st quarter of grade 9 comes to an end, I realize how difficult grade 9 is. There's so many things to memorize, many assignments, and many performance tasks. 

In ICT, I believe that the hardest lesson for me was mostly forms because of how long the lesson was and how many attributes and tags we need to remember. I feel more confident in my performance tasks than my quizzes and tests. But despite the difficulties, I realize how fun coding can be. Sure, your code may not work always, but once it does, it feels so rewarding to see the 70+ line code finally work the way you intended. 

There's so much to look forward to it the next few quarters. Some are scary and nerve-wracking, some are happy and exciting, but I'm ready to greet whatever comes our way with open arms.
